    <h2>My First Lesson</h2>
    <p>I had my first lesson at the start of August 2017 at the Bargara Golf Club Driving Range.</p>
    <h3>What I learnt:</h3>
    <p>
      <ul>
        <li>how to hold a club, including the grip</li>
        <li>the stance</li>
        <li>aiming for a target</li>
        <li>the swing and follow through</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>What I like about Golf</h2>
    <p>I like that it's a slow and steady game of great skill and it takes precision. I also like that you can walk around in a giant park in the great outdoors all day while you play.</p>
