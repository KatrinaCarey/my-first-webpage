      <ul>
        <li>how to hold a club, including the grip</li>

        <li>aiming for a target</li>

    <h2>What I like about Golf</h2>
    <p>I like that it's a <em>slow and steady</em> game of great skill and it takes precision. I also like that you can walk around in a giant park in the great outdoors all day while you play.
